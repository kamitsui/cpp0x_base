# =========================
# 1. Line Endings Handling
# =========================

# Force LF for source code (avoid CRLF issues)
*.c      text eol=lf
*.h      text eol=lf
*.cpp    text eol=lf
*.hpp    text eol=lf
*.py     text eol=lf
*.sh     text eol=lf

# Keep native line endings for text files (useful for platform-specific files)
*.md     text
*.txt    text
*.json   text
*.yaml   text
*.yml    text

# Force CRLF for Windows scripts
*.bat    text eol=crlf
*.cmd    text eol=crlf

# =========================
# 2. File Type Customization
# =========================

# Treat Markdown and text files as plain text for Git diff
*.md     diff
*.txt    diff

# Ignore diff for binary files (to prevent unnecessary Git diffs)
*.png    binary
*.jpg    binary
*.jpeg   binary
*.gif    binary
*.mov    binary
*.ico    binary
*.pdf    binary
*.zip    binary
*.tar.gz binary
*.mp4    binary
*.mp3    binary

# Prevent automatic merging of binary files (manual merge required)
*.doc    binary merge=union
*.docx   binary merge=union
*.ppt    binary merge=union
*.pptx   binary merge=union

# =========================
# 3. Git Large File Storage (LFS)
# =========================

# Use Git LFS for large binary files to optimize repository size
*.psd    filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs
*.ai     filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs
*.zip    filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs
*.tar.gz filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs
*.mp4    filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs
*.mp3    filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs
*.mov    filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs
*.gif    filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs

# =========================
# 4. Exporting & Versioning Rules
# =========================

# Exclude compiled and intermediate files from export (when using `git archive`)
*.o      export-ignore
*.obj    export-ignore
*.exe    export-ignore
*.dll    export-ignore
*.so     export-ignore
*.class  export-ignore
*.pyc    export-ignore
*.pyo    export-ignore

# Ignore debug and log files from versioning
*.log    export-ignore
*.bak    export-ignore
